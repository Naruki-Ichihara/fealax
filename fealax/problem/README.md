# Problem Module Refactoring

This directory contains the refactored problem components extracted from the monolithic `problem.py` file.

## Module Structure

- `boundary_conditions.py` - Boundary condition classes and management
- `kernels.py` - Weak form kernel generation and compilation
- `assembly.py` - Global assembly and sparse matrix construction
- `problem_setup.py` - Problem initialization and data structure setup
- `__init__.py` - Main problem interface and exports

## Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each module focuses on one aspect of finite element problems
2. **Clean Interfaces**: Well-defined APIs between modules  
3. **Minimal Dependencies**: Reduced coupling between components
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing API for users
5. **Testability**: Components can be tested independently

## Refactoring Goals

- Reduce main problem.py from 1,257 lines to ~200-300 lines
- Improve code organization and maintainability
- Enable better testing and debugging of individual components
- Facilitate future extensions and modifications
